## PANCAKE FLIPPER COUNTER

This program will properly determine the minimum number of
flips required to properly orientate a randomly orientated
stack of Happy Face Pancakes happy side up.

Analyzing each stack using X-ray vision, test cases have been
established. Cakes requiring a flip are denoted with a 1
(indicating true, or yes, it needs a flip) cakes happy side up
not requiring a flip are denoted with a 0 in the array
(indicating false, or no, it does not need to be flipped).

from the command line run:
```bash
go run main.go
```
